# Book API ðŸ“š

This is a RESTful API built with Express, MongoDB, and Node.js that provides information about a collection of books. The API contains details on 300+ books related to programming and other categories. It offers various endpoints to fetch book details, categories, names, and supports filtering based on categories, ID, author's name, page count, and more.
